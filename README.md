# Hearing Test

This is a small app that helps occupational health workers to determine whether someone has hearing loss or not.

None of the current tools have updated to the latest guidelines around hearing loss, and by entering the test results readings here they can get a definitive diagnosis.

The application is unique in that rather than banding by age, it calculates thresholds based on the specific age of the patient.
